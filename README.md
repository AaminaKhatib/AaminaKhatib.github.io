# Aamina Khatib Personal Profile Website - aaminakhatib.github.io

## Description 
A project was given to us to develop a website which will act as a personal profile/digital CV. Tasks were assigned each day and the project had to be live by day's end. This website provides details such as education history, certifications, skills and achievements about the developer. A job experience section can be added to the site for it to function as a CV. The website content can be easily adapted by a different user for the same purpose.

## Troubleshooting
### CORPWIFI Issue
Known problems with the site include certain restrictions created by CORPWIFI which, on occasion, does not allow the site to load. To date, a workaround has not been found for this as the exact reason for the issue has not been identified. For presentation purposes, the most recent version can be downloaded and presented locally.  

### Struggled to clone repository
A challenge in creating the site was Github for Desktop’s issue in cloning the repository from the internet. The workaround for this was cloning the repository through the terminal and then committing through the Visual Studio Code application. 

### Code in folders not readable
A challenge was encountered on the GitHub web application whereby only code in the index file would be read and the stylesheets etcetera which were in folders would not be read. The workaround was to entirely remove folders.
